    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This creamy chicken vol-au-vent recipe is an easy yet impressive puff pastry appetizer. Thanks to some simple shortcuts, you'll get all the praise for half the work!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>      
        <li>1 package (17.30 ounces) frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>6 bacon strips</li>
        <li>2 medium leeks (white parts only), sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet yellow pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>Minced fresh parsley plus additional ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. On a lightly floured surface, unfold 1 puff pastry sheet. Using a 3-1/4-in. round cutter, cut out 6 circles. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Unfold the remaining pastry sheet. Cut 6 more circles out with the 3-1/4-in. round cutter; with a 2-1/2-in. cutter, cut centers out of the circles. Place the rings on top of the circles that are on the baking sheet. Place the center circles also on the baking sheet. In a small bowl, whisk egg and water; brush over pastries. Chill 15 minutes. Bake until dark golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings. Add leeks and pepper to drippings; cook and stir over medium-high heat until tender, 5-7 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in bacon, chicken, cream cheese, salt and pepper. Cook and stir until blended; remove from heat.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, hollow out pastries with a small knife. Fill with chicken mixture. Sprinkle with parsley and pepper. Serve with small center pastries on the side.</li>
    </ol>
